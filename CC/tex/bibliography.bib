	abstract="The general asymmetric (and metric) TSP is known to be approximable only to within an O(log n) factor, and is also known to be approximable within a constant factor as soon as the metric is bounded. In this paper we study the asymmetric and symmetric TSP problems with bounded metrics and prove approximation lower bounds of 101/100 and 203/202, respectively, for these problems. We prove also approximation lower bounds of 321/320 and 743/742 for the asymmetric and symmetric TSP with distances one and two.",
