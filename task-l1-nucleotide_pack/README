nucleotide_pack_task

Input file .fasta looks like:
>string_name\n
atgcc...[actually nucleotide sequence. May be interrupted with ANY OTHER characters (except '>'), which should be skipped without errors. ]
We CAN store the whole sequence (but only one) in memory.

Output file .gfasta looks like:
>string_name\n
[4 bytes int representing number of nucleotides in this sequence][encoded nucleotide sequence, end of sequence is coded as character distinct from the alphabet.]
We should store 6 groups of 10 symbols on a single line.

Usage:
./nucleotide_pack [pack/unpack] in_file out_file

Ready for check.
