Combination of wc and sort programs.
Should sort strings, which are ended with '\n'. Other characters are arbitrary (even '\0' can take place).
We can read the whole file into memory, but we should use dynamic memory allocation with realloc (i. e. we can't allocate memory for the whole file using fstat).
Also we should print number of strings, words and characters in fille to stdout. Words are separated with isspace characters. Empty string is string.
We can't use our gets_safe function and <string.h>.
